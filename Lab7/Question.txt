Write a program with priority queue for public transportation management system.
The system has one bus, three bus stations (B1, B2, B3), and many passengers (max 1000).
B1 is the first bus station, B2 is the second one and B3 is the last. Passengers can get on the bus from the bus stations B1 and B2. But all
passengers have to get off the bus at the last bus station B3.

Bus design permits a full 8 passengers to travel in comfort with ample leg room on both sides of the aisle. Hence, maximum 8 passengers
can travel on the bus.
Passengers have the following attributes: age and type (student or normal). The passengers, who are 65 years old or older, don&#39;t have a
passenger card, because free public transport is available for everyone 65 years old and over. If the passenger is a student, the system
should decrease 1 TL from the card for the journey; else the system decreases 2 TL.
In order to get on the bus, passengers enter into the queue at the bus stations B1 and B2. The passengers 70 years of age and over have
priority, they should travel first.
The passenger information should be read from a text input file (c:\\data.txt). The first record must be inserted into the related priority
queue, and then the second record must be inserted and so on. When a passenger 70 years or older is coming, the order in the queue must
be updated.
After all passengers in the input file are added into the queues, the bus journey is started. If the bus canâ€™t transport all the passengers at
the bus stations, it comes again for the remaining passengers in the next tour. It is required from the application to print the passengers at
the bus stations B1 and B2 at each tour. The program should also display the overall income from the bus.
