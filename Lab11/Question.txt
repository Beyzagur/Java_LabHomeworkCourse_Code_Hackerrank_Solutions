 Write a Circular Linked List class which includes the following methods:

 - Add (which inserts a new element to the beginning of the list)
 - Display (which prints all items in the list) 
 - Josephus(X,Y) (which determines the last remaining man in the circle)

The "Josephus" problem is to identify the position of the last remaining man when X men stand in a circle and every Y^th
th man will be successively eliminated from the circle.

 Write a main program that takes two integers (X and Y) from the user and then prints the result of the "Josephus" problem. Example:

CircularLinkedList CLL = new CircularLinkedList();
// Take X and Y from the user
// for ... add numbers to the circular queue
 CLL.Add(i);
CLL.display(); // 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
System.out.println(Josephus(X,Y));
