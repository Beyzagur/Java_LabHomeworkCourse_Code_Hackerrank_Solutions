Write a Single Linked List class that contains the following methods:
insert() // inserts an element to the single linked list (add to the end of the list)
display() // prints all elements in the single linked list
barGraph() // prints the distinct elements in the single linked list as a horizontal bar graph
Write a main program that
- inserts randomly generated 16 English letters (from A to E) into a single linked list,
- calls display() method to print all elements in the list
- calls barGraph() method to print the distinct elements with the bars horizontally.

Sample Output:
Randomly generated single linked list: C E A A A B E E C C C B A C C D
Bar Graph
A ****
B **
C ******
D *
E ***
