Write a program that constructs a multi-linked list from a two-dimensional array with any size and then traverse multi-linked
list to determine whether the matrix is a scalar matrix or not.
A scalar matrix is basically a square matrix whose all diagonal elements are equal and all other elements means off diagonal
elements are zero.
Donâ€™t take any input from the user. Assign the matrix in the code.

Examples:
int[][] matrix ={{55,0,0,0,0},
	 	 {0,55,0,0,0},
 		 {0,0,55,0,0},
 		 {0,0,0,55,0},
		 {0,0,0,0,55}}
Output: true

int[][] matrix ={{18,0,0,0},
 		 {0,18,0,0},
		 {0,0,18,0},
      		 {0,0,0,18}}
Output: true

int[][] matrix ={{6,0,0,0,0,0},
		 {0,6,0,0,0,0},
		 {0,0,6,0,0,5},
		 {0,0,0,6,0,0},
		 {0,0,0,0,6,0},
		 {0,0,0,0,0,6}}
Output: false

int[][] matrix ={{6,0,0,0,0,0},
		 {0,6,0,0,0,0},
		 {0,0,6,0,0,0},
		 {0,0,0,6,0,0},
		 {0,0,0,0,7,0},
		 {0,0,0,0,0,6}}
Output: false
